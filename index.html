    <h1>Mario Facts</h1>

        <p class="one-p">Mario is a fictional character in the Super Mario video game franchise, which is owned by Nintendo and created by Shigeru Miyamoto.<br>

        <p class="one-p">Mario’s entire design was a way to get around the limitations that pixelated images presented at the time. His mustache was given to him because it was too hard to make a good mouth.<br>
             He wore a hat because realistic hair was too hard to make and he wore overalls so that we could tell that his arms were swinging past the yellow buttons when he was walking or running.</p>

The “Chain Chomp” was inspired by Shigeru Miyamotos childhood experience being chased by dogs who were chained.<br><br><br><br><br><br> <span>4</span>.An island in Mario 3 looks like Japan, and its castle is where Kyoto would be, which is also where Nintendo headquarters are. The king of this castle looks like Mario, who you could say is the king of Nintendo.</p>
        <p><span>2</span>.Whomps were likely based on the Japanese mythological creatures known as “Nurikabe.” Nurikabe were said to take the figure of a wall to trick or trap travelers.<br><br><br><br><br><span>5</span>.The super mushrooms used in Mario was based on a fungi named Amanita Muscaria. They make the user feel as though they are growing in size. The effect was also referenced in Alice in Wonderland.</p>
         <p><span>3</span>.Super Mario 3D Worlds double character power up came from a member of staff accidentally putting two controllable Marios on screen at the same time.<br><br><br><br><span>6</span>.Wario was designed to be much fatter than Mario because Marios hat is set to “M” for “Medium,” while Wario’s is set to “W” for “Wumbo.”</p>
